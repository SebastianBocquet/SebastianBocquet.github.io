					<h3>Survey Science Cosmology</h3>
					<p>I am actively involved in cosmological surveys that explore the sky and our
					universe at different wavelengths: the South Pole Telescope (SPT,
					millimeter-waves or microwaves), the Dark Energy Survey (DES, optical), and
					eROSITA (extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array, X-ray). I am
					also involved in the preparation for upcoming surveys such as Euclid and the
					Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) (both are optical
					surveys) and CMB-S4, a next-generation ground-based mm-wave survey.<br>

					Some of the key questions I am trying to answer with these survey data are
					related to the origin of the observed accelerated late-time expansion of the
					universe, the mass of neutrinos, and our ability to provide a coherent
					description of all cosmological observations.</p>

					<h4>Abundance of dark matter halos</h4>

					<p>The abundance (or number) of dark matter halos (and the galaxy clusters they
					host) above a given mass and at a given redshift has long been recognized to be
					extremely sensitive to some cosmological parameters such as the matter density
					Ω<sub>m</sub> and the variance in the matter density field σ<sub>8</sub>. Performing this
					measurement over a range of redshifts thus also allows to constrain the dark
					energy equation of state parameter <em>w</em>. Finally, the combination of abundance
					measurements with measurements of the primary anisotropies in the cosmic
					microwave background (CMB) radiation allows to constrain the sum of neutrino
					masses.

					Plenty of discoveries to go after! However, in practice, all these measurements
					are limited by our ability to accurately measure the masses of dark matter
					halos.</p>

					<h4>Multi-probe cosmology using clusters of galaxies</h4>

					<p>The key for a successful cosmological analysis using halo abundances is to adopt
					a multi-probe multi-observable mass calibration strategy. In the following I
					describe such an analysis.</p>

					<h4>Galaxy cluster selection using the South Pole Telescope survey</h4>

					<p>The South Pole Telescope detects galaxy clusters through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
					effect: low-energy CMB photons (remember, the CMB is 2.7 K) scatter off the hot
					gas that is trapped by the halo's gravitational potential. This leads to a small
					but measurable spectral distortion in the CMB along the line of sight of a
					cluster. The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect is independent of redshift. On the one
					hand, this means that we need other data to obtain cluster redshifts, but it
					also means that the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect allows us to detect clusters at
					high redshifts where other means of detection run out of sensitivity.</p>

					<h4>Weak-lensing observations of galaxy clusters</h4>

					<p>The most accurate approach to measure the mass scale of galaxy clusters is to
					exploit the effect of gravitational lensing, which is sensitive to the full mass
					of a halo (and not just its visible galaxies or hot gas). The advent of large
					optical weak-lensing surveys such as DES make this approach particularly
					attractive. At higher redshifts, targeted observations using the largest
					ground-based telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope allow us to cover
					redshifts up to about 1.1
					(e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07591">Schrabback, Bocquet et al. 2020</a>).</p>

					<h3>Theoretical modeling using numerical simulations</h3>

					<p>On large scales, cosmic structure formation can accurately be described by
					perturbation theory. However, scales smaller than a few megaparsecs evolve
					non-linearly as matter collapses under its own gravitational pull and forms
					filaments and dark matter halos. A lot of cosmological information is contained
					in these non-linear scales. To access these scales from a theoretical modeling
					perspective, we use numerical cosmological simulations. In these, the matter
					density field is evolved and allow us to track its evolution well into the
					non-linear regime.</p>

					<h4>Cosmic emulation</h4>

					<p>As discussed, we have to rely on numerical simulations to describe the
					non-linear matter density field. Originally, this approach was used to calibrate
					a correction of the linear theory. However, this correction may itself depend on
					the cosmological parameters we are trying to measure. The solution is emulation:
					a suite of cosmological simulations is run for a range of different cosmologies,
					and an interpolation technique then allows to make predictions for the quantity
					of interest at any new cosmology.<br>

					Using the Mira-Titan Universe suite of cosmological simulations, I constructed
					an emulator for the halo mass function. The 111 input cosmologies cover 8
					cosmological parameters, including the effects of dynamical dark energy and
					massive neutrinos. I did not "teach" the emulator anything about the halo mass
					function being approximately universal; the emulator is purely data-driven. The
					accuracy is at the few-percent level in the cluster mass range at low redshifts
					(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12116">Bocquet et al. 2020</a>).</p>
