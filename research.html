          <h3>Survey Science Cosmology</h3>
          <p>I am actively involved in cosmological surveys that explore the sky and our
          universe at different wavelengths: the South Pole Telescope (SPT,
          millimeter-waves or microwaves) and the Dark Energy Survey (DES, optical).
          I am
          also involved in the preparation for upcoming surveys such as Euclid and the
          Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) (both are optical
          surveys) and CMB-S4, a next-generation ground-based mm-wave survey.<br>

          Some of the key questions I am trying to answer with these survey data are
          related to the origin of the observed accelerated late-time expansion of the
          universe, the mass of neutrinos, and our ability to provide a coherent
          description of all cosmological observations.</p>

          <h4>Abundance of dark matter halos</h4>

          <p>The abundance (or number) of dark matter halos (and the galaxy clusters they
          host) above a given mass and at a given redshift has long been recognized to be
          extremely sensitive to some cosmological parameters such as the matter density
          Ω<sub>m</sub> and the variance in the matter density field σ<sub>8</sub>. Performing this
          measurement over a range of redshifts thus also allows to constrain the dark
          energy equation of state parameter <em>w</em>. Finally, the combination of abundance
          measurements with measurements of the primary anisotropies in the cosmic
          microwave background (CMB) radiation allows to constrain the sum of neutrino
          masses.

          Plenty of discoveries to go after! However, in practice, all these measurements
          are limited by our ability to accurately measure the masses of dark matter
          halos.</p>

          <h4>Multi-observable cosmology using clusters of galaxies</h4>

          <p>The key for a successful cosmological analysis using halo abundances is to adopt
          a multi-observable mass calibration strategy. In the following, I describe such
          an analysis.</p>

          <h4>Galaxy cluster selection using the South Pole Telescope survey</h4>

          <p>The South Pole Telescope detects galaxy clusters through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
          effect: low-energy CMB photons (remember, the CMB is 2.7 K) scatter off the hot
          gas that is trapped by the halo's gravitational potential. This leads to a small
          but measurable spectral distortion in the CMB along the line of sight of a
          cluster. The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect is independent of redshift. On the one
          hand, this means that we need other data to obtain cluster redshifts, but it
          also means that the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect allows us to detect clusters at
          high redshifts where other means of detection run out of sensitivity.</p>

            (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04121">Bleem, Bocquet et al. 2020</a>).</em></p>

          In 2024, the collaboration released the full catalog of galaxy clusters detected in
          the first-generation SPT-SZ data and in the second-generation SPTpol dataset. The
          analyses represent a milestone and prerequisite for the ongoing analysis of SPT-3G data.

          <h4>Weak-lensing observations of galaxy clusters</h4>

          <p>The most accurate approach to measure the mass scale of galaxy clusters is to
          exploit the effect of gravitational lensing, which is sensitive to the full mass
          of a halo (and not just its visible galaxies or hot gas). The advent of large
          optical weak-lensing surveys such as DES make this approach particularly
          attractive (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12213">Bocquet et al. 2024 I</a>).
          At higher redshifts, targeted observations using the largest
          ground-based telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope allow us to cover
          redshifts up to about 1.1
          (e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07591">Schrabback, Bocquet et al. 2020</a>).</p>

          <h4>Multiprobe Cosmology from the Abundance of Clusters, Galaxy Clustering, and Weak Lensing</h4>

          Cosmic shear, galaxy clustering, and the abundance of massive halos each probe the large-scale
          structure of the universe in complementary ways. I led an analysis that presents cosmological
          constraints from the
          joint analysis of the three probes, building on the latest analyses of the lensing-informed abundance
          of clusters identified by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and of the auto- and cross-correlation
          of galaxy position and weak lensing measurements (3×2pt) in the Dark Energy Survey (DES).

          <h3>Theoretical modeling using numerical simulations</h3>

          <p>On large scales, cosmic structure formation can accurately be described by
          perturbation theory. However, scales smaller than a few megaparsecs evolve
          non-linearly as matter collapses under its own gravitational pull and forms
          filaments and dark matter halos. A lot of cosmological information is contained
          in these non-linear scales. To access these scales from a theoretical modeling
          perspective, we use numerical cosmological simulations. In these, the matter
          density field is evolved and allow us to track its evolution well into the
          non-linear regime.</p>

          <h4>Cosmic emulation</h4>

          <p>As discussed, we have to rely on numerical simulations to describe the
          non-linear matter density field. Originally, this approach was used to calibrate
          a correction of the linear theory. However, this correction may itself depend on
          the cosmological parameters we are trying to measure. The solution is emulation:
          a suite of cosmological simulations is run for a range of different cosmologies,
          and an interpolation technique then allows to make predictions for the quantity
          of interest at any new cosmology.<br>

          Using the Mira-Titan Universe suite of cosmological simulations, I constructed
          an emulator for the halo mass function. The 111 input cosmologies cover 8
          cosmological parameters, including the effects of dynamical dark energy and
          massive neutrinos. I did not "teach" the emulator anything about the halo mass
          function being approximately universal; the emulator is purely data-driven. The
          accuracy is at the few-percent level in the cluster mass range at low redshifts
          (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12116">Bocquet et al. 2020</a>).</p>

          <h4>Halo mass maps</h4>
          To interpret the weak-lensing measurements discussed above, we need reliable
          models of the mass distribution within massive halos. We have used numerical
          simulations to establish such models. Our latest cosmological analysis is
          indeed based on our halo mass model (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16212">
