Well, this is the code for my website. I used the Alpha template from https://html5up.net/.

I keep the publication list and citation stats up to date by running an automated daily python script using GitHub actions.
It grabs the latest publication list and citation counts from ADS.
It also grabs the citation metrics from Google Scholar.
Just take a look at build_pub.py!
